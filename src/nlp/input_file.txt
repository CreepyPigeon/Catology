Here is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothen in white
Stand in the light
Here is the soul of a man
Time to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a man
When the world was virgin
Before the coming of man
Just a solemn witness
The beginning of the end
From a world of magma
To a cold rock face
The ascent of madness
And the human race
We are strange believers
All of us
There are stranger truths
In molten rust
We rise from slumber
It calls our name
Recalls our number
how bad we come
Reefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
